  Hey there! I'm <strong>Kamesh R (காமேஷ்)</strong> from Chennai, India — an AI researcher deeply interested in <strong>reasoning systems</strong>, <strong>AI for science</strong>, and <strong>quantization techniques</strong> for efficient, scalable machine learning models. My work focuses on making AI systems think more logically, reason better, and run lighter without losing performance.
</p>
<p>
  I’m passionate about exploring the fundamentals of machine learning theory and how reasoning capabilities can be enhanced in modern AI systems. I also enjoy working on open-source projects and collaborating with peers on research that pushes boundaries.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond research, I'm proudly rooted in my culture. I have a deep love for <strong>தமிழ்</strong>, my mother tongue, and enjoy studying its history, literature, and linguistic richness.  
</p>
<p>
  And when I’m not coding or writing papers, you’ll probably find me cheering for <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com" target="_blank">Liverpool FC</a> in the Premier League. ❤️  
</p>
