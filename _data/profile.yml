  Hi there! I'm <strong>Kamesh R (காமேஷ்)</strong> from Chennai, India, an AI researcher working on Reasoning and Quantization techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
  I absolutely love <strong>தமிழ்</strong>, my mother tongue, and I take pride in exploring its history and it's linguistic richness.
  </p>
  <p>
  When it comes to football, I'm a devoted follower of the Premier League.  
  Nothing excites me more than cheering for <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com" target="_blank">Liverpool FC</a>, the club I passionately support. ❤️  
  I also enjoy teaching and writing in my free time. Curiosity drives me, and I’m always curious to learn more and explore
  new ideas. 😊
  </p>
