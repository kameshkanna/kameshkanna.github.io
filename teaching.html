  <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; line-height: 1.6; text-align: justify; margin: 1rem 0;">
    I believe teaching should be approachable, engaging, and rooted in real-world relevance. By breaking down complex ideas into manageable concepts and emphasizing hands-on learning, I strive to make technical subjects accessible and practical for students. My goal is to create an environment that fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and a strong foundation for lifelong learning.
